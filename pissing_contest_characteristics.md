# Pissing Contest Game Design Document

## Game Flow
Challenge issued with amount -> Opponent accepts -> Roll characteristics (always 1 each) -> Roll for natural conditions (small chance) -> Apply characteristic-induced conditions (override natural) -> Self-conditions override all -> Calculate 4 metrics with modifiers -> Weight score (Distance 40%, Volume 25%, Aim 20%, Duration 15%) -> Determine winner -> Dazza comments (low chance unless forced by matchup) -> Announce results with contextual crude joke

## Scoring Algorithm
- Distance: 40% weight (most important)
- Volume: 25% weight
- Aim: 20% weight
- Duration: 15% weight

## Hydration System
- Uses existing drink_counter from !beer command (24hr reset)
- First pissing contest: bladder_amount = current drink_counter value
- After contest: bladder_amount = 0
- Additional drinks increment bladder_amount from 0
- Both reset at 6am daily
- 0 bladder doesn't prevent contest, just reduces performance
- Each beer = +5% volume, max +100% at 20 beers

## Implementation Notes
- Characteristics that induce conditions override natural condition rolls
- Self-conditions always take priority (immunity mechanics)
- Mutual conditions affect both players simultaneously
- Distance-boosting characteristics should be rare due to 40% score weight
- Dazza commentary has low chance unless forced by specific matchups
- Weather is random each match but influenced by time of day
- Locations are random but weighted by time brackets
- Small fines only ($5-10) to keep game casual
