## Critical Findings: Original Crash Prevention

### ✅ **SUCCESS**: Original Crash Scenario Cannot Be Reproduced

The comprehensive testing confirms that **the exact conditions that caused the original crash are now prevented**:

#### 1. **Media:change Event Loop Prevention** ✅
- **Original Issue**: Infinite loop between MediaManagementService and ConnectionHandler
- **Protection Active**: Event deduplication immediately blocks duplicate `media:change` events
- **Evidence**: Test logs show "Duplicate event ignored: media:change" preventing the infinite loop
- **Result**: **Crash prevented - loop cannot form**

#### 2. **Source Loop Detection** ✅  
- **Original Issue**: Modules processing their own events recursively
- **Protection Active**: Source loop detection immediately blocks recursive self-emission
- **Evidence**: "Source loop detected: TestModule trying to emit recursive:call it's already processing"
- **Result**: **Stack overflow prevented at the source**

#### 3. **Circuit Breaker Protection** ✅
- **Original Issue**: System unable to recover from recursion cascade
- **Protection Active**: Circuit breaker opens after 3 recursion protection failures
- **Evidence**: "Circuit breaker opened due to recursion protection failures"
- **Result**: **System protected from cascade failures**

#### 4. **Emergency Shutdown System** ✅
- **Original Issue**: No graceful degradation when problems occurred
- **Protection Active**: Automatic emergency shutdown on unhandled rejections
- **Evidence**: "Emergency shutdown initiated: unhandled_rejection"
- **Result**: **Graceful shutdown prevents crashes**

## Test Scenario Analysis

### 🎯 **Original Crash Conditions Recreation**

**Test Objective**: Recreate the exact infinite `media:change` loop from the original crash

**Result**: ✅ **CRASH PREVENTED**

**Protection Sequence**:
1. First `media:change` event processed normally
2. Subsequent duplicate events immediately blocked by deduplication
3. No infinite loop formed
4. System remained stable

**Evidence**: 
```
[EventBus:DEBUG] Emitting event: media:change (depth: 1, id: wktl1l4wwx1ayizxffi6i)
[EventBus:DEBUG] Event completed successfully: media:change (depth: 0)
[EventBus:DEBUG] Duplicate event ignored: media:change
[EventBus:DEBUG] Duplicate event ignored: media:change
```

### 🔄 **ImageHealthChecker Timeout Scenario**

**Test Objective**: Simulate the 5-minute timeout that triggered the original crash

**Result**: ✅ **TIMEOUT HANDLED SAFELY**

**Protection Sequence**:
1. Health check timeout event processed
2. Associated `media:change` events triggered
3. Duplicate events immediately blocked
4. No cascade failure occurred
