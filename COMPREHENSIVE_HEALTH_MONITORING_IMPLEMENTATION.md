## Health Status Levels

The system uses a comprehensive health status hierarchy:

### Status Levels
- **Healthy**: All systems operating normally (score ≥ 0.95)
- **Warning**: Some metrics approaching thresholds (score ≥ 0.85)
- **Degraded**: Performance impact but system stable (score ≥ 0.70)
- **Critical**: Potential failure conditions detected (score ≥ 0.50)
- **Failed**: Component or system failure occurred (score < 0.50)

### Health Scoring
Health scores are calculated using weighted averages based on component priority:
- **Critical components**: Weight 4 (memory management, database, core systems)
- **High priority**: Weight 3 (API services, connection management)
- **Medium priority**: Weight 2 (standard modules and services)
- **Low priority**: Weight 1 (non-essential components)

## Protection System Integration

The health monitoring system integrates with all existing protection mechanisms:

### 1. Memory Management Integration
- **Memory pressure monitoring**: Tracks memory usage thresholds

- **Cleanup effectiveness**: Measures memory cleanup success rates
- **Leak detection**: Correlates memory growth with health degradation

### 2. Stack Monitoring Integration

- **Recovery monitoring**: Measures stack recovery success
- **Performance correlation**: Links stack depth to system performance

### 3. Event Bus Integration
- **Recursion protection**: Monitors event bus recursion detection
- **Circuit breaker status**: Tracks event bus circuit breaker states
