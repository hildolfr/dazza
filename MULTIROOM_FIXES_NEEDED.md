# Multi-Room Implementation: Current State and Required Fixes

**Generated**: 2025-07-01  
**Branch**: multiroom-refactor  
**Bot Status**: Running with multi-room support (connected to both rooms)

## Executive Summary

The multi-room support implementation is functionally complete and the bot is running successfully in both `fatpizza` and `always_always_sunny` rooms. However, several components need updates to be fully room-aware, and there are some errors that need resolution.

## Current Working State

### âœ… Core Infrastructure (100% Complete)
1. **MultiRoomBot Architecture**
   - Bot successfully connects to multiple rooms simultaneously
   - Each room has its own connection instance and state context
   - Room configurations loaded from `rooms/` directory
   - Authentication working (bot logs in to both rooms)

2. **Database Schema**
   - All necessary tables have `room_id` columns added
   - Migration system working correctly
   - Room tracking tables created (`rooms`, `room_user_presence`)

3. **Room Management**
   - RoomContext class manages per-room state (userlist, media, etc.)
   - Event routing directs events to correct room handlers
   - Room-specific message sending via `bot.sendMessage(roomId, message)`

4. **Updated Components**
   - `tell.js` - Fully room-aware
   - `remind.js` - Fully room-aware
   - HeistManager - Using multiroom version with room isolation

## Known Issues Requiring Fixes

### 1. HeistManager SQLITE_CONSTRAINT Error
**Error**: `Failed to initialize HeistManager: {"errno":19,"code":"SQLITE_CONSTRAINT"}`
**Cause**: Likely trying to insert duplicate 'dazza' user in user_economy table
**Location**: `src/modules/heist/HeistManager_multiroom.js` line 75
**Fix Needed**: 
```javascript
// Change line 75 from:
await this.db.run('INSERT INTO user_economy...')
// To:
await this.db.run('INSERT OR IGNORE INTO user_economy...')
```

### 2. Reminder Checking Error
**Error**: `Error checking reminders:`
**Cause**: Reminder checking function needs room context
**Location**: Periodic task in MultiRoomBot
**Fix Needed**: Update reminder checking to iterate through all rooms

### 3. Commands Need Room Context Updates

#### Economy Commands (Priority: HIGH)
These commands interact with bot.heistManager or send messages without room context:
- `balance.js` - Needs `bot.sendMessage(message.roomId, ...)`
- `mug.js` - Needs room context for messages
- `give.js` - Needs room context for messages
- `coin_flip.js` - Needs room context for messages and challenges
- `pissing_contest.js` - Needs room context for challenges
- `forceheist.js` - Admin command needs room context
- `heistadvance.js` - Admin command needs room context
- `heiststatus.js` - Status display needs room context
- `nextheist.js` - Next heist time display needs room context

#### Game Commands (Priority: MEDIUM)
- `beg.js` - Needs room context for messages
- `bottles.js` - Needs room context for messages
- `cashie.js` - Needs room context for messages
- `centrelink.js` - Needs room context for messages
- `couch_coins.js` - Needs room context for messages
- `mystery_esky.js` - Needs room context for messages
- `pokies.js` - Needs room context for messages
- `scratchie.js` - Needs room context for messages
- `sign_spinning.js` - Needs room context for messages
- `tab.js` - Needs room context for messages

#### Fun Commands (Priority: LOW)
- `8ball.js` - Needs room context for messages
- `bong.js` - Needs room context for messages and database logging
- `clap.js` - Needs room context for messages
- `compliment.js` - Needs room context for messages
- `drink.js` - Needs room context for messages and database logging
- `fact.js` - Needs room context for messages
- `fish.js` - Needs room context for messages
- `gallery.js` - Needs room context for messages
- `goth.js` - Needs room context for messages
- `insult.js` - Needs room context for messages
- `mood.js` - Needs room context for messages
- `roll.js` - Needs room context for messages
- `translate.js` - Needs room context for messages
- `yeah.js` - Needs room context for messages

#### Stats Commands (Priority: MEDIUM)
- `channelstats.js` - Needs room filtering option
- `criminal.js` - Needs room context for messages
- `peak.js` - Needs room filtering option
- `seen.js` - Needs room context for user lookup
- `stats.js` - Needs room filtering option
- `top.js` - Needs room filtering option
- `urls.js` - Needs room filtering option
- `when.js` - Needs room filtering option

#### Admin Commands (Priority: LOW)
- `award.js` - Needs room context for messages
- `clear.js` - Needs room context for clearing
- `dazza.js` - Needs room context for responses
- `memory.js` - Global command, no changes needed
- `monitor.js` - Global command, no changes needed

### 4. Managers Need Room Awareness

#### VideoPayoutManager (Priority: HIGH)
- Needs to track video queues per room
- Payout messages need room context
- Database calls need roomId parameter

#### PissingContestManager (Priority: MEDIUM)
- Challenges need to be room-specific
- Messages need room context
- Database storage needs room_id

### 5. Periodic Tasks Need Updates

#### Reminder Delivery
- Check reminders for all rooms
- Deliver to correct room based on room_id in database

#### Stats Collection
- Ensure stats are collected per-room where appropriate

## Implementation Guide for Fixes

### Pattern 1: Updating Commands for Room Context

```javascript
// OLD:
bot.sendMessage('some message');

// NEW:
bot.sendMessage(message.roomId, 'some message');
```

### Pattern 2: Database Calls with Room Context

```javascript
// OLD:
await bot.db.logUserBong(username);

// NEW:
await bot.db.logUserBong(username, message.roomId);
```

### Pattern 3: Manager Updates

```javascript
// Add room tracking to manager state
this.roomStates = new Map(); // roomId -> state

// Update methods to accept roomId
async startChallenge(challenger, target, amount, roomId) {
    const roomState = this.getRoomState(roomId);
    // ... room-specific logic
}
```

### Pattern 4: Accessing Room-Specific State

```javascript
// Get userlist for current room
const userlist = message.roomContext.userlist;

// Check if user is in current room
const user = message.roomContext.getUser(username);
```

## Testing Checklist

### Basic Functionality
- [ ] Bot connects to both rooms
- [ ] Bot authenticates in both rooms
- [ ] Basic commands work in each room
- [ ] Messages are sent to correct room only

### Room Isolation
- [ ] Heists in one room don't affect the other
- [ ] User lists are separate per room
- [ ] Cooldowns are room-specific where appropriate
- [ ] Stats can be filtered by room

### Data Integrity
- [ ] Database stores room_id correctly
- [ ] No cross-room data leakage
- [ ] Global economy remains consistent
- [ ] User stats aggregate properly

### Error Handling
- [ ] Bot handles room disconnection gracefully
- [ ] Commands fail gracefully if room context missing
- [ ] No crashes from missing room data

## Priority Order for Fixes

1. **Critical** (Do First)
   - Fix HeistManager SQLITE_CONSTRAINT error
   - Fix reminder checking error
   - Update heist-related commands

2. **High Priority**
   - Update economy commands for room context
   - Make VideoPayoutManager room-aware
   - Update stats commands for room filtering

3. **Medium Priority**
   - Update game commands for room context
   - Make PissingContestManager room-aware
   - Update remaining database logging commands

4. **Low Priority**
   - Update fun commands for room context
   - Update admin commands where needed
   - Add room filtering to web API endpoints

## Migration Path for Remaining Work

1. Create a systematic approach:
   - Group similar commands together
   - Use search/replace for common patterns
   - Test each group before moving to next

2. Use agents for bulk updates:
   - Have agents update similar commands in batches
   - Ensure consistent patterns are followed
   - Verify no commands are missed

3. Test incrementally:
   - Test each major component after updates
   - Verify room isolation is maintained
   - Check database integrity

## Conclusion

The multi-room implementation is successful and running. The remaining work is primarily updating individual commands and managers to be room-aware. This is mostly mechanical work following established patterns. The architecture is solid and proven to work.

Total estimated time for remaining fixes: 4-6 hours of focused work.
