# Note on Test File Console Usage

The file `WordCountAnalyzer.test.js` uses console statements for test output, which is appropriate because:

1. **Test Runner Output**: This is a standalone test file that outputs results directly to the console
2. **Not Production Code**: Test files are development tools, not part of the running application
3. **Visual Test Results**: Console output provides immediate feedback on test success/failure
4. **Performance Metrics**: The file includes performance testing that needs to display timing results

## Current State
The test file already uses a mock logger for the analyzer instance itself, which is the correct approach. The console statements are only used for:
- Test result display
- Performance metrics
- Summary statistics

This is standard practice for test files and does not need to be changed.
