# Comprehensive Memory Management System Implementation

## Overview

A complete memory pressure monitoring and automatic cleanup system has been implemented to prevent memory-related crashes and provide early warning of memory issues. The system provides proactive protection against memory leaks while maintaining system performance.

## üöÄ Key Features Implemented

### 1. **Memory Pressure Monitor** (`src/utils/MemoryPressureMonitor.js`)
- **Real-time memory usage tracking** with configurable thresholds
- **Configurable pressure levels**: Warning (80%), Critical (90%), Emergency (95%)
- **Memory leak detection** using pattern analysis and growth rate monitoring
- **Component memory tracking** for individual modules/components
- **Heap space analysis** and RSS/external memory monitoring
- **Garbage collection management** and efficiency tracking
- **Event-driven pressure alerts** with configurable cooldowns

### 2. **Memory Cleanup Manager** (`src/utils/MemoryCleanupManager.js`)
- **Escalating cleanup strategies** with four levels:
  - **Gentle**: Clear expired cache entries and old data
  - **Moderate**: Reduce cache sizes and clear processing queues
  - **Aggressive**: Clear large data structures and reset components
  - **Emergency**: Disable non-essential components and force multiple GC cycles
- **Component-specific cleanup** with configurable limits
- **Automatic cleanup orchestration** based on memory pressure levels
- **Cleanup history and statistics** tracking

### 3. **Core Memory Manager** (`src/core/MemoryManager.js`)
- **Central orchestrator** integrating pressure monitoring and cleanup management
- **Automatic cleanup triggers** when memory pressure reaches threshold levels
- **Emergency shutdown protection** to prevent system crashes
- **Component shutdown and restart** management
- **Memory management lifecycle** handling with proper initialization and cleanup
- **Comprehensive memory statistics** and reporting

### 4. **Enhanced Module Integration** (`src/modules/memory-management/`)
- **Backward compatibility** with existing legacy memory monitoring
- **Service registration** and event forwarding
- **Dual monitoring system** (legacy + enhanced) for seamless transition
- **Component registration** for memory tracking

## üìä Configuration Options

    enabled: true
    autoCleanup: true
    emergencyShutdown: true
    
  alerts:
    enabled: true
    cooldown: 300000          # 5 minutes between alerts
    emergencyCooldown: 60000  # 1 minute between emergency alerts
```

## üéØ Target Areas for Cleanup

### Automatically Managed Components:
- **Message processing caches** (processedMessages, messageHistory)
- **Event history and EventBus** memory
- **Image health checker** batch processing
- **Connection state and reconnection** tracking
- **Database connection pooling** and cache cleanup
- **Timer and interval cleanup** integration

### Component-Specific Limits:

## üõ†Ô∏è Available Commands

### 1. **Enhanced Memory Command** (`!memory`)
- **Basic usage**: Shows current memory usage and pressure level
- **Verbose mode**: `!memory -v` - Detailed statistics and pressure events
- **Enhanced information**: Pressure level, emergency mode status, cleanup statistics
- **Backward compatibility**: Works with both legacy and enhanced monitoring

### 2. **Emergency Memory Command** (`!emergency-memory`)
- **Cleanup actions**: `!emergency-memory cleanup [level]` - Force cleanup at specific level
- **Garbage collection**: `!emergency-memory gc [cycles]` - Force GC cycles
- **System status**: `!emergency-memory status` - Detailed system status
